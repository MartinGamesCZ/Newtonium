# Newtonium
TypeScript and Rust based framework for building desktop applications using TypeScript and React. Newtonium is built on Webkit, Rust and Bun (with React using Next.JS), so it should be faster and lighter than Electron.

This project is in early development stage, so it's not recommended to use it in production.

## Roadmap
- [x] Working prototype
- [ ] Custom webkit embedding
- [ ] Custom IPC
- [ ] Internal client library
- [ ] Support for building background services
